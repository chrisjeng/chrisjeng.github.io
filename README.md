# Chiken
The next new cloud-computing based machine-learning innovative solution to the world's problems to make the world a better place.

# USE SAFARI TO TEST!
Currently, Chrome doesn't render the images correctly....

## Folks
- Angel, Chris, Devin, Kat

## How to play
- If the chicken gets too hungry (hunger meter runs out) or gets too lonely (love meter runs out), it will die! Don't let that happen!
- Feed the chicken by clicking the food area at the bottom-left.
- Love the chicken by rubbing the chicken's tummy! Loving tends to make the chicken a little bit hungry!
- Don't overfeed the chicken!
- Keep the chicken alive for as long as you can!

## TODO
- Need to add some sort of guide-rails to ensure people don't let the chicken die. For example, if the chicken is starving early game, tell them to feed the chicken by clicking. Show warnings when the chicken is about to die. This might require some sort of pause concept.
- A start menu. The game doesn't start until the start button is pressed, and the game should pause when the game is over.
- Use sounds. For example when the heart gets empty, have some sort of heartbroken sound. Also eating sounds.
- Exploding death from overeating
- Heartbroken chicken death
- Starving chicken death
- Ensure all food images are of similar-ish size
