## USE SAFARI TO TEST LOCALLY!
Currently, Chrome doesn't render the images correctly....

## Folks
- Angel, Chris, Devin, Kat

## How to play
- If the chicken gets too hungry (hunger meter runs out) or gets too lonely (love meter runs out), it will die! Don't let that happen!
- Feed the chicken by clicking the food area at the bottom-left.
- Love the chicken by rubbing the chicken's tummy! Loving tends to make the chicken a little bit hungry!
- Don't overfeed the chicken!
- Keep the chicken alive for as long as you can!

## TODO
- (Chris) Make a game over action (yield control, stop bg music, stop changing hunger/love)
- (Kat) Asteroids functionality
- (Open) Special deaths (overeating, heartbroken, starving)
