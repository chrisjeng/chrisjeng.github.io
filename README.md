# Chiken
The next new cloud-computing based machine-learning innovative solution to the world's problems to make the world a better place.

# USE SAFARI TO TEST!
Currently, Chrome doesn't render the images correctly....

## Folks
- Angel, Chris, Devin, Kat

## How to play
- If the chicken gets too hungry (hunger meter runs out) or gets too lonely (love meter runs out), it will die! Don't let that happen!
- Feed the chicken by clicking the food area at the bottom-left.
- Love the chicken by rubbing the chicken's tummy! Loving tends to make the chicken a little bit hungry!
- Don't overfeed the chicken!
- Keep the chicken alive for as long as you can!

## TODO
- (Angel) Chicken needs to get fatter upon eating
- (Devin) Make a dead chicken image
- (Kat) Need some sort of guidelines/pop up text to help people keep the chicken alive. For example, if the chicken is starving early game, tell them to feed the chicken by clicking. Show warnings when the chicken is about to die.
- (Open) Exploding death from overeating. Heartbroken chicken death. Starving chicken death. (Chicken cannot die from too much love)
- (Open) Upgrade game concept to include more things to do. See Ideas for more

## Ideas for more

We're almost done. We need to do a little bit more. Couple options:
- Multiple chickens
- Asteroids falling
- Combination of both?
